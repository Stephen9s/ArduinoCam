The Arduino Security Camera was my graduate project written in Ruby and communicated with an Arduino to control a motor. The web interface allowed the front-end user to communicate via serial to the Arduino and motor. A camera should be mounted on the motor and turned on using the web interface; once triggered, motion-detection software called Motion establishes a connection to the webcam to snap photos.
